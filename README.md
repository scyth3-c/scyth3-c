Hi! my name is Kevin, I'm 19 years old and I live in Colombia, since I'm in high school I have ventured into the world of electronics and programming, I have experience working with micro controllers, programmable and embedded boards example of these are Pic, Arduino, Raspberry Pi etc.. I started in the world of programming with C++ on my own, since then I discovered how much I like this world, from there I was trying new technologies, new languages, I continued with javascript, Python, Php etc.. today I want to work as a web developer and continue learning and testing new technologies.
